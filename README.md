# aws-inventory

This is a personal project I'm working on for tracking AWS Inventory and costs. I just started this today (Jan 16, 2016). It's not even functional yet. I'm still in early phase of development.

## Overview

I'm potentially considering using tags and Placement Groups as the main source of identifying logical groups of items. Tags may be more feasible considering that not all people will be using Placement Groups.

You will need to use the aws-sdk-go configuration. See https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go
